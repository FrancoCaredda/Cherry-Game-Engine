# Cherry-Game-Engine
### Why do we create game engine?

This game engine will be used for our own games. 
We don't want to use other game engines, because we want to try to write our own technology.

### What do we want from this project?
We want to support OpenGL and Vulkan, write ray tracing global illumination, have the newest animation technologies.


Cherry game engine is on early developing stage.
